      <p id="adacher-quote"><i>"Let's be honest. There's nothing great about the real world, is there? It's just dull and annoying as hell. No one accepts that's the way things are... They're just stuck with it because they can't deny it, either. Those who actually succeed in life... They just happen to be born with the magic ticket called "talent." If you don't have it, you can either accept or deny that fact until you die. That's your only choice. Once you realize that, all you have left in life is despair. The ultimate game over. Wouldn't it be better if that kind of reality was wiped away?"</i></p>
      <p>--Tohru Adachi, Persona 4</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tribute-desc">
      <p>I honestly think that Tohru Adachi is an extremely well-written character in Persona 4. In a nutshell, he foils Yu Narukami, the motivation that keeps him, the Investigation Team, and his confidants moving forward, where he represents the nihilism that is associated when one has an unhealthy outlook on life. If you want to learn more about this complex character, I recommend that you play through Persona 4 (the original or Golden, your choice), or you can read about his character <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Tohru_Adachi">here</a>.</p>
