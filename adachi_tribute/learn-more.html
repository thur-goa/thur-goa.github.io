        <p class="spacer">All right, here comes the character analysis-- just kidding. I'll keep it brief for this.</p>
        <p class="spacer">Tohru Adachi is an extremely well-written villian in Persona 4. Throughout the progression of the story, it can be seen that he foils Yu Narukami, the motivation that keeps him, the Investigation Team, and his confidants moving forward. On the other hand Adachi represents the nihilism that is associated when one has an unhealthy outlook on life.</p>
        <p class="spacer">I think considering the themes of Persona 4, and it's concentration on friendship as a concept, seeing both the dynamic between Tohru Adachi and Yu Narukami highlights the importance of bonds between people. Similarly to how a plant requires water to nurish itself and grow, as people, relationships are important in order for one's self to evolve their perspectives in a positive way. Tohru Adachi is a representation of the opposite of this growth mindset, and shows what potentially can happen to a person if they isolate themselves to a point where they live in their own echo chamber.</p>

      <div id="sec-3">
        <p class="spacer">If you want to learn more about Tohru Adachi, and his role in Persona 4, then I highly recommend that you play through Persona 4 (either the original or Golden is fine).</p>
