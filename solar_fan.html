    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000" font weight="bolder">Hello, welcome to my first archive post. There a lot of things that I am interested in, and
    it feels all interconnected in a way. Think of it like a spider web being formed, where different bugs are being attracted to for a spider to feast on. Pretend I'm
    the spider and the different types of bugs that I can eat are all of the ideas in my mind that I like to entertain. If bugs to a spider consists of different tastes,
    textures, and smells, ideas to me are an accumulation of things that I like to predict, whether it's wondering about something big as whether the universe can split
    into sub-universes, to something as small as how my favorite characters can interact in an alternate unvierse. With that imagery out of the way, for awhile now, I've 
    enjoyed diving into the potential of renewable energy and how it can assist in cleaning up the pollution within the planet.</font>
