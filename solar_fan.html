    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000">Hello, this is the first time I'm posting about something I've worked on for awhile. There a lot of things that I am interested in, and
    it feels all interconnected in a way. Think of it like a spider web being formed, where different bugs are being attracted to for a spider to feast on. Pretend I'm
    the spider and the different types of bugs that I can eat are all of the ideas in my mind that I like to entertain. If bugs to a spider consists of different tastes,
    textures, and smells, ideas to me are an accumulation of things that I like to predict, whether it's wondering about something big as whether the universe can split
    into sub-universes, to something as small as how my favorite characters can interact in an alternate reality. With that imagery out of the way, for awhile now, I've 
    enjoyed diving into the potential of renewable energy and how it can assist in cleaning up the pollution within the planet. A lot of the time, whenever renewable
    energy application is being talked about, a lot of it is being applied on a bigger scale, such as electric generation or transporation. However, I have wondered
    as to whether it can be applied onto a smaller scale. Maybe like everyday objects that people use? Besides renewable energy, I've also have dived into 3D printing
    and the things that one can do with it. 3D printing is an amazing discovery, because of the fact you can basically make anything you wanted (well, as long as you
    have a program and the printer, but you know what I mean).</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000">Now, you may be thinking to yourself, "Ruth, what was that entire monologue you've delivered
    leading up to?" I've flirted with the idea of making whatever I thought of, and because I had time to kill during summer vacation, why not actualize one of my ideas?
    The hot rays of the sun during the hellish summer can be utilized into something that can make suriving during the season a (bit) bareable. A solar powered fan! I
    am very well-aware that this phenomenom of a project is nothing novel. However, I have wanted to try making something from scratch, and this was one of the ideas that
    I wanted to try making happen. What I mean by making something from scratch, is the entire thing, and this is what the point of this post is going to be. Join me, like
    how Sam joined Frodo on his journey to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mordor, and read through the process of how it all came together.</font>

    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000"> Now, before I actually did anything, I wanted to first get the idea of making this solar powered
      fan out of my mind. So I took a piece of paper, and jotted down how I imagined the fan would look like. At this stage, I wasn't really caring about any of the details, but
      rather the general idea of how I wanted my fan to look like. After sketching out a rough outline of the fan, I did some hypothetical measurements to see how big I wanted 
      it to be. For that, the overall measurments (not including the measurments for each specific part) would be 7 x 7 inches. My idea was that the fan would be small enough to 
      be portable, as the battery that I'll be using will be powered through a solar power, which would be perfect for having a cooling source while one was outside. You'd be able 
      to take it on a car trip, on a picnic, to a concert, on a hike, pretty much anywhere one can think of. (As I'm writing this, I now think that it could've been designed to act
      more as a handheld, rather than having a stand since I thought about it being a portable. However, that can be something that I can do if I end up revisiting this again.)

  <p>
    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000"> With the basic sketch finished, I began to start designing it on SolidWorks to create a 3D model that I
      was going to end up printing. I will say that I didn't stick to the hypothetical measurments when I did the initial prototype design, as I thought it might've been too small for
      my liking. Which is why I sized it up a bit by a couple of inches. Because the fan will also require me to do a bit of electrical work (unfortunately), I had to take into account
      the measurements for the components I'll be using. The components that I used for this project will be covered later on in this post.
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000"> After finishing the model for the initial prototype, the overall measurements came up to around 12 x 11 inches.
      The more specific measurements of the fan (i.e. blades, panels, base components) will be illustrated on the below blueprint.

  </p>
  <p>
     <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000"> Because of how I don't have a 3D printer ready and on standby, I would have to search for a place that offered 3D printing services.
       Thankfully, one of the nearby libraries in my town did offer this, so I sent all of files for them to be printed out. The process was relatively quick as it only took around a week
       from the time I sent in my request, to when I was notified that my prints were ready to pick up. Once I have picked up my prints, this is when I ran into a couple of issues with the
       initial design of the fan. From first impressions, I underestimated the size of the fan components, as when it came to trying to assemble it, it ended up being too big from how I
       imagined it to be. With the size that it was, it's wasn't the portable fan that I was dreaming of. Going a bit more into how the prototype came out, there were a lot of design issues
       that can be pointed out. Some of these included that the fan vents being too thin to a point where the rim of the back panel didn't evem attach to the vent, and also some of the areas
       where each component would be attached were either too loose or didn't fit in at all.

  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000"> From the initial prototype, there were a couple things that I had to keep in mind when redesigning the fan;
  </p>
  <p>
     <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000">➡ Sizing is a very obvious one
  </p>
  <p>
     <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000">➡ Making sure that all the areas where the 3D printed components attach fit properly
  </p>
  <p>
     <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000">➡ Accomodating for the sizing and placement of the electrical components of the fan
  </p>
  <p>
     <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000">➡ Ensuring the stability of all of the parts
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000"> With all of this in mind, I went back to the drawing board and did another 3D model of the fan. I kind of find this very similar to video game companies
      when figuring out a design for their game characters. Think about it, they first have to come up with an initial design for a characters and then they go through a lot of refinement while they're in the testing
      stages of a game before coming out with a final design. I find that the process is kind of interesting, as a character can turn out to be different both in design and personality when you compare
      both the beginning and final stages of their design.
