    <font size="3" font face="monospace" color="#000000" font weight="bolder">Hello, welcome to my first archive post. There a lot of things that I am interested in, and
    it feels all interconnected in a way. Think of it like a spider web being formed, where different bugs are being attracted to for a spider to feast on. Pretend I'm
    the spider and the different types of bugs that I can eat are all of the ideas in my mind that I like to entertain. If bugs to a spider consists of different tastes,
    textures, and smells, ideas to me are an accumulation of things that I like to predict, whether it's wondering about something big as whether the universe can split
    into sub-universes, to something as small as how my favorite characters can interact in an alternate reality. With that imagery out of the way, for awhile now, I've 
    enjoyed diving into the potential of renewable energy and how it can assist in cleaning up the pollution within the planet. A lot of the time, whenever renewable
    energy application is being talked about, a lot of it is being applied on a bigger scale, such as electric generation or transporation. However, I have wondered
    as to whether it can be applied onto a smaller scale. Maybe like everyday objects that people use? Besides renewable energy, I've also have dived into 3D printing
    and the things that one can do with it. 3D printing is an amazing discovery, because of the fact you can basically make anything you wanted (well, as long as you
    have a program and the printer, but you know what I mean).</font>

    leading up to?" I've flirted with the idea of making whatever I thought of, and because I had time to kill during summer vacation, why not actualize one of my ideas?
    The hot rays of the sun during the hellish summer can be utilized into something that can make suriving during the season a (bit) bareable. A solar powered fan! I
    am very well-aware that this phenomenom of a project is nothing novel. However, I have wanted to try making something from scratch, and this was one of the ideas that
    I wanted to try making happen. What I mean by making something from scratch, is the entire thing, and this is what the point of this post is going to be. Join me, like
    how Sam joined Frodo on his journey to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mordor in Lord of the Rings, and read through the process of how it all came together.</font>
